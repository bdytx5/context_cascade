But saving money can be more than providing for some future need. Saving itself can be a virtue. Once you start saving money, you’ll feel good about what you have achieved. You’ll want to save more and be able to experience the peace of mind of knowing that you can take care of yourself and those you care about. \n\n Abraham Lincoln said, “Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.” But what is happiness? According to many philosophers, it is enjoying what you have, not wishing for more. Consider what some people learn well into their lives—that the accumulation of possessions does not bring happiness! By keeping your life simple, you don’t get used to having more and more and keeping up with what everyone else is doing. This means not continually buying “things” that have to be protected and maintained. Instead, you can enjoy life without having to earn large sums of money to achieve some high standard of consumer spending. \n\n In today’s competitive marketplace, people frequently lose their jobs and must retrain and even find a new career. If you keep your life simple, you won’t have a lot of payments to make. Then, if you lose your job, you will be less likely to lose your house, car, and other possessions. If you stay liquid, you can more easily move and start a new career and have money on hand to get you through jobless periods. \n\n Many people buy things they don’t need, with money they don’t have, to impress people they don’t like. Those who love and care about you aren’t impressed with how much money you spend or all the possessions you own. Wouldn’t it be better to put money aside so that you can retire early, enjoy traveling, or live comfortably without the stress of keeping up with the rat race? Remember, even if you win the rat race, you’re still a rat! \n\n Think Critically \n\n 1.\t Do you sometimes buy things that you later wish you hadn’t?

You cannot buy anything else on credit until you pay down the current balance. Maxing out is not a good idea. Here’s why: \n\n ■■ When you get really close to the top, it is very easy to “go over.” If you have given your creditor permission to authorize purchases that put you over your credit limit, you will be charged an over-the-limit fee. Going over the limit also gives credit card issuers a reason to raise your interest rate. At the creditor’s discretion, it may charge a penalty rate, which is an interest rate that varies by creditor but which can rise as high as 25 percent or more depending on the balance.   \n■ When your cards are maxed out, you cannot use the card. Having the credit card offers no advantages when you cannot use it for current purchases. You must be careful not to use it until you have created enough room for additional charges.   \n■ Having maxed-out credit cards does not look good on your credit report. It tells potential creditors that you are already overextended and unable to pay down existing debts.   \n■■ A significant portion (30 percent) of your credit score is based on how much of your available credit you're using. If you max out your credit card, you can be sure that your credit score will drop.   \n■ People with maxed-out credit can fall prey to “easy access” credit, such as payday loans, no-credit-check loans, bad credit loans, and pawnshops. These forms of credit have very high rates of interest and put you in a cycle of borrowing beyond your means.   \n■ When you pay down your charges regularly, credit card companies will be more willing to raise your credit limit. But when the card is maxed out, the credit card company will not likely extend additional credit, even if you need it for a major purchase. If you repeatedly max out your credit card, some companies will close or put a freeze on your account, requiring you to pay the entire amount in full before you can use the card again. \n\n For all these reasons, avoid the practice of maxing out your cards. Keep a healthy amount of unused credit on hand, just in case you need it. \n\n Think Critically \n\n 1.\t How might maxing out your credit card affect your lifestyle? 2.\t If you were a creditor and someone with maxed-out cards asked you for a loan, would you grant it?

This great   \nsavings rate is the result of many factors, including   \nthe economy’s good performance, the economic   \nand financial well-being of the Japanese popu  \nlation, and the good interest rates available on   \ntime deposits (CDs). In contrast, U.S. individual and   \nhousehold savings ranged between 4 and 5 percent   \nin this same time period. That trend has somewhat \n\n reversed in the United States, with people saving more following the Great Recession (2007–2009). But savings rates still remain far below those of Japan. \n\n Think C r i t i c a l ly \n\n Why do you suppose people in the United States save more following an economic downturn? Why do you suppose people in Japan save more during an economic boom? \n\n LO 2-2 Selecting a Savings Plan \n\n There are important factors to consider when selecting a savings account and a savings institution. All savings or investment options involve a trade-off between liquidity or safety and yield. The safer or more liquid an investment, the less earning potential it is likely to have. Use the following criteria in judging which savings options best meet your needs: liquidity, safety, convenience, interest-earning potential (yield), and fees and restrictions. \n\n Liquidity \n\n Liquidity is how quickly you can turn savings into cash when you want it. The need for liquidity will vary, based on your age, health, family situation, and overall wealth. For example, if you have little money left over after paying your bills, you may need to keep this money liquid so you can get it quickly, without penalty, if you face some emergency. In this case, a regular savings account or money market account would be best for you. CDs impose a penalty if you withdraw early, so you should choose this option when you don’t expect to need the money before the maturity date. \n\n Safety \n\n You want your money to be safe from loss. Safety of principal means that you are guaranteed not to lose your savings deposit, even if the bank or other financial institution fails and goes out of business. Most financial institutions are insured by either the FDIC or NCUA. Accounts protected by insurance are safe for up to $\\mathcal{S}250\\mathrm{,000}$ . You should be sure the financial institution of your choice has federal insurance to protect your deposit. Deposits in banks, no matter what type, are almost always safer than investments in the stock market. \n\n Convenience \n\n People often choose their financial institution because of convenience of location. Many banks have several branches within a limited geographic area, which makes your banking convenient. Some banks even have locations in grocery stores and residential areas. A very large bank may have branches in other states, giving you banking privileges while out of town. \n\n"

Keep your card in view during transactions and get it back as soon as you can to avoid giving others the opportunity to steal your credit card information either manually or by swiping it on an electronic reader.   \nKeep your sales receipts and promptly verify all charges on your credit card statements, using the procedure printed on your statement to question charges that you think are in error.   \nTear up old receipts no longer needed that contain account information. Don’t lend your card to anyone or leave it lying around your home or office.

In addition, there are some steps you can take to help protect your credit card and personal information when making online transactions. \n\n Deal only with companies online that you know and trust.

                "value": "Commercial Banks \n\n Commercial banks, also known as fullservice banks, provide the widest variety of banking services of any of the financial institutions. Some of these services include safe deposit boxes, 24-hour ATM networks, money transfer services, and loan and investment services. Commercial banks also offer many kinds of savings and checking accounts. Having checking and savings accounts at the same bank makes it easy for people to transfer funds and make deposits and withdrawals. By linking checking and savings accounts, customers can avoid certain service fees. Almost all commercial banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This insurance protects depositors from loss due to bank failure, up to $\\mathcal{S}250,\\!000$ per account. \n\n Why would you want your checking and savings accounts at the same bank? \n\n Savings Banks \n\n Savings banks are usually referred to as mutual savings banks. These financial institutions are few in number—about 500 of them in roughly a dozen states, mostly throughout New England and the Northeast—but substantial in size. Two primary services offered by these institutions are savings accounts and loans on real property, including mortgages and home-improvement loans. Savings banks are insured by the FDIC. \n\n Savings and Loan Associations \n\n Savings and loan associations $(S e\\!\\!\\!\\slash\\!\\!\\!\\slash\\!\\!\\!\\slash\\!\\!\\!\\!\\slash\\!\\!\\!\\!\\slash\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\slash\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\slash\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\left\\langle S\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\right\\rangle$ are organized primarily to lend money for home mortgages. S&Ls offer many of the services of commercial banks, including interest-bearing checking accounts and special savings plans. You may find a slightly higher interest rate on savings at an S&L. S&Ls are insured by the FDIC. \n\n Credit Unions \n\n Credit unions are not-for-profit organizations established by groups of people, such as employees in similar occupations who pool their money. To use a credit union, you must be a member of the group. Potential members have to meet membership requirements that vary depending on the credit union’s objective. For example, a corporation’s credit union may accept only employees and their immediate family members. A credit union for teachers, on the other hand, may accept any teacher who works for a certain school district. A few credit unions have more relaxed requirements and may simply request that members live in a certain city or area. \n\n Credit unions are owned by their members, who save their money in the form of “shares,” or part ownership in the credit union. From funds accumulated by these shares, the credit union makes loans to its members, generally at lower interest rates. Savings and checking accounts at a credit union are usually called share accounts. Credit unions generally offer higher interest rates on savings accounts than commercial banks do. Checking accounts have low (or no) average daily balance requirements and, generally, no service fees. If you are eligible for credit union membership, this type of checking account may be the least expensive and most convenient option. \n\n"

To have a financially secure retirement, you must begin to save regularly as early in life as you can. \n\n Peace of Mind \n\n Probably the best reason to save is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that when needs arise, you will have adequate money to pay for them.

It is the base on which your savings will grow. For the use of your money, the financial institution pays you money called interest. Interest represents earnings on your deposit. \n\n As principal and interest grow, more interest accumulates. This is known as compound interest, or interest paid on the original principal plus accumulated interest. Figure 6.1 illustrates how interest is compounded annually. Notice how interest earned each year increases because the saver is earning interest on the previous year’s interest as well as on the initial deposit. \n\n The more often interest is compounded, the greater your interest earnings will be. Figure 6.2 illustrates what happens when 6 percent interest is compounded quarterly (every three months) and added to the principal before more interest is calculated.

The topics of credit and credit cards will be discussed in more detail in Unit 2. \n\n Overdraft Protection \n\n Overdraft protection allows you to cover checks or withdrawals up to a specified amount, usually between $\\mathcal{S}100$ and $\\mathcal{S}1\\mathcal{S}00$ , depending on the typical balance in your account. With overdraft protection, your checks will be covered even if you have insufficient funds in your checking account. Protection may be offered in the form of an instant “loan” with high interest rates. Other banks may charge a flat fee.

Banks may charge transfer fees for this type of protection. \n\n Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) \n\n Many banks provide ATMs for their customers. At an ATM, you can make cash withdrawals (using your debit card) from your checking or savings account. Using a Visa or MasterCard, you can receive a cash advance electronically.

For safety, do not carry your PIN in written form. Commit it to memory. \n\n Online and Telephone Banking \n\n Most financial institutions offer online and telephone banking services. These services give you the ability to access your accounts from a computer or telephone, transfer money from one account to another, and pay bills by authorizing the bank to disburse money. You can find out your current balance, what checks have cleared, and which deposits have been entered. Online and telephone banking enable you to access your account any time, day or night. \n\n Most banks also allow and encourage electronic transfers of money. An electronic funds transfer (EFT) uses a computer-based system that enables you to move money from one account to another without writing a check or exchanging cash. This can be done by telephone, by computer, or in person. Money is available immediately (there is no delay as with waiting for a check to clear). Electronic transfers can also be made between banking institutions, and funds are available immediately. \n\n"

They had mortgaged their homes to the limit, taking out second ­mortgages in order to cash out their equity. Credit accounts and balances were at an all-time high as consumers bought goods and services to enjoy life’s luxuries. For many families, a second or third job became a reality to pay the high bills that went along with living the dream. \n\n With the economic downturn, many jobs were lost and people with lots of debt were unable to pay their bills. Credit card companies felt the squeeze as collections dropped while delinquencies rose. To increase profitability and reduce risk, they took immediate and harsh actions. Unfortunately, their actions resulted in further hardships for many Americans. \n\n Citibank closed millions of consumer credit accounts. These included both new (those less than two years old) and long-standing accounts. Regardless of payment records or how well consumers had managed their accounts, they were closed. Visa, MasterCard, and American Express all lowered credit limits and closed accounts as well. Fixed interest rates became variable and were raised substantially with a 30-day written notice. Consumers had no choice but to accept the higher rates or face having their account closed if they opted out. \n\n Other creditors raised minimum payment requirements. If they had formerly required 1 percent of the balance to be paid monthly, that became 2 to 5 percent. Thus, a minimum payment of $\\S\\,1\\,00$ a month became $\\S300$ or more a month. With lower wages and lost jobs, it was impossible for many Americans to make these higher payments. As a result of all of these actions, credit scores and ratings dropped significantly for many Americans. \n\n Many people found the practices of credit card companies to be both unethical and illogical. As a result, many Americans turned away from credit and started using debit cards instead. With the passage of the Credit CARD Act of 2009, the government is trying to tame some of the abusive and deceptive tactics used by credit card companies. However, credit card companies are already coming up with new ways to increase their profitability.

You look around and there is no one nearby to claim the card. If you leave it there, someone else may fnd it. What would you do?   \n2. You make a payment on your credit account at a customer service center. The worker, who is new and in training, accidentally credits your account for more than you paid. For example, you gave her $S25$ and she credited your account twice, totaling $\\S50$ . What would you do?   \n3. Someone you know returns merchandise to a store and gets a credit on his charge account, knowing that he purchased the merchandise elsewhere. What would you do?   \n4. Your friend frequently buys clothing on credit, wears it to a special event, and returns it to the store before the account is due, claiming the garment is damaged or dirty. She then receives a credit or a refund for the merchandise. What would you do?   \n5. Your friend Tonya wants to borrow money, but you have none to give her. You have loaned money to her in the past, but she has not repaid it. Your other friend Sally has some extra money from a side job. If you vouch for your friend Tonya, then Sally will lend her the money based on your word. What would you do?   \n6. Another customer at the credit union where you belong has the same last name as you. Last month, the customer made her car payment of $s_{350}$ , but the credit union accidentally posted her payment to your savings account. It has been a month and nothing has happened; the credit union has not reversed the entry. What would you do? \n\n"

Unfortunately, many people never assess how much future income they have already committed to debt and whether the types and sources of credit they use are most advantageous to them. You can avoid this trap by periodically making a careful assessment of your debt load throughout your life. A debt load is the amount of outstanding debt at a particular time. Whether your debt load is acceptable to you will depend on your ability to meet the regular payments, your ability to pay off the debt quickly if necessary, and your level of comfort with the amount of debt you owe. \n\n Complete your debt-load analysis, using Worksheet 4 provided for you in the Student Activity Guide and also presented for reference below. Compute your self-score. Assessing your debt load will help you determine the severity of your debt problem so that you can take corrective action if necessary.

These major projects require expert design to be sure they are safe and meet building standards and codes, while at the same time are aesthetically pleasing and designed for durability. \n\n Architects spend most of their time in offices, where they consult with clients to learn the objectives, requirements, and budget of a project; develop construction plans and drawings; and work with other architects and engineers. When a major project has begun, architects also visit construction sites to review the progress of the projects. \n\n Employment Outlook \n\n Faster than the average rate of employment growth is expected. \n\n Job Titles \n\n Architect Architectural Engineer • Architectural Designer \n\n Needed Skills \n\n A five-year professional degree from a school accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) is required in most states.   \nA passing grade on the   \nArchitect Registration Exam   \nis required. \n\n A training period must be completed by working as an intern at an architectural firm. Strong analytical and technical skills, along with high creativity, are required. \n\n What’s it like to work in . . Architecture \n\n Adam has worked for a large architectural firm for nearly five years. He began as an intern until he gained enough experience to work jointly on projects. He often works more than 50 hours a week but is well compensated with a yearly salary of $\\S86{,}000$ . He has a variety of duties, including consulting with clients, preparing scaled drawings of projects, and preparing contract documents for building contractors. \n\n Adam spends most of his time in his office, which is equipped with computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and building information modeling (BIM) technology for creating designs and construction drawings. However, as construction proceeds on projects, he also visits building sites to ensure that contractors are following the design, staying on schedule, and meeting workquality standards. \n\n What About You? \n\n Do you like working independently and on teams? Are you creative? Do you have strong analytical and technical skills? Are you willing to work for five years on a degree plus do an internship? If so, a career in architecture might be right for you. \n\n"

These major projects require expert design to be sure they are safe and meet building standards and codes, while at the same time are aesthetically pleasing and designed for durability. \n\n Architects spend most of their time in offices, where they consult with clients to learn the objectives, requirements, and budget of a project; develop construction plans and drawings; and work with other architects and engineers. When a major project has begun, architects also visit construction sites to review the progress of the projects. \n\n Employment Outlook \n\n Faster than the average rate of employment growth is expected. \n\n Job Titles \n\n Architect Architectural Engineer • Architectural Designer \n\n Needed Skills \n\n A five-year professional degree from a school accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) is required in most states.   \nA passing grade on the   \nArchitect Registration Exam   \nis required. \n\n A training period must be completed by working as an intern at an architectural firm. Strong analytical and technical skills, along with high creativity, are required. \n\n What’s it like to work in . . Architecture \n\n Adam has worked for a large architectural firm for nearly five years. He began as an intern until he gained enough experience to work jointly on projects. He often works more than 50 hours a week but is well compensated with a yearly salary of $\\S86{,}000$ . He has a variety of duties, including consulting with clients, preparing scaled drawings of projects, and preparing contract documents for building contractors. \n\n Adam spends most of his time in his office, which is equipped with computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and building information modeling (BIM) technology for creating designs and construction drawings. However, as construction proceeds on projects, he also visits building sites to ensure that contractors are following the design, staying on schedule, and meeting workquality standards. \n\n What About You? \n\n Do you like working independently and on teams? Are you creative? Do you have strong analytical and technical skills? Are you willing to work for five years on a degree plus do an internship? If so, a career in architecture might be right for you. \n\n"

                "value": "LO 1-2 Creditworthiness \n\n Before potential creditors grant credit to you, they must determine whether you are a good risk—that you are creditworthy. To determine this, most lenders utilize some variation of the five $^{\\mathfrak{c}}\\!C^{\\flat}\\!s^{?\\flat}$ of credit: character, capacity, capital, conditions, and collateral. \n\n Character: Are You Responsible? \n\n Character is a responsible attitude toward honoring obligations, often judged on evidence in the person’s credit history. If you have character, you pay your bills on time, and your credit history will show it. \n\n In addition to your credit history, creditors also use stability as a measure of character. For example, a person who has held four different jobs over the past year or has gaps in employment might not be considered a good credit risk. \n\n Capacity: Can You Repay Your Debts? \n\n The financial ability to repay a loan with present income is known as capacity. Before lending you money, creditors want to make certain that your current income is sufficient to cover your current expenses each month plus the payments on the new loan. Capacity is often measured as a percentage of take-home pay. For example, as a rule of thumb, payments on your credit card (and other forms of revolving credit) should not exceed 20 percent of your take-home pay. So, if your take-home pay is $\\S2{,}000$ a month, your revolving credit should not exceed $\\mathbb{S}400$ a month. \n\n Capital: Do You Have Sufficient Assets? \n\n Capital is the value of financial assets (bank accounts, investments, and property) you possess after deducting your debts. In other words, when you add up all that you own (assets) and subtract all that you owe (liabilities), the difference (net worth or capital) should be sufficient to ensure payment of your debt. Having capital tells creditors that you are in the process of building wealth and providing for your future financial security. Sometimes when your balance sheet is healthy enough, creditors will overlook other requirements. With a lot of financial assets, you are a solid low-risk borrower. \n\n Conditions: What Else Is Going On? \n\n There may be “external” conditions that affect your ability to repay a debt.

For example, if the economy is slowing and many people in your geographic area are losing their jobs, creditors may be less willing to give you a loan. If you lose your job, you may not be able to meet your payments. Therefore, creditors want to know the answers to questions such as the following: How secure is your job?

                "value": "LO 1-2 Creditworthiness \n\n Before potential creditors grant credit to you, they must determine whether you are a good risk—that you are creditworthy. To determine this, most lenders utilize some variation of the five $^{\\mathfrak{c}}\\!C^{\\flat}\\!s^{?\\flat}$ of credit: character, capacity, capital, conditions, and collateral. \n\n Character: Are You Responsible? \n\n Character is a responsible attitude toward honoring obligations, often judged on evidence in the person’s credit history. If you have character, you pay your bills on time, and your credit history will show it. \n\n In addition to your credit history, creditors also use stability as a measure of character. For example, a person who has held four different jobs over the past year or has gaps in employment might not be considered a good credit risk. \n\n Capacity: Can You Repay Your Debts? \n\n The financial ability to repay a loan with present income is known as capacity. Before lending you money, creditors want to make certain that your current income is sufficient to cover your current expenses each month plus the payments on the new loan. Capacity is often measured as a percentage of take-home pay. For example, as a rule of thumb, payments on your credit card (and other forms of revolving credit) should not exceed 20 percent of your take-home pay. So, if your take-home pay is $\\S2{,}000$ a month, your revolving credit should not exceed $\\mathbb{S}400$ a month. \n\n Capital: Do You Have Sufficient Assets? \n\n Capital is the value of financial assets (bank accounts, investments, and property) you possess after deducting your debts. In other words, when you add up all that you own (assets) and subtract all that you owe (liabilities), the difference (net worth or capital) should be sufficient to ensure payment of your debt. Having capital tells creditors that you are in the process of building wealth and providing for your future financial security. Sometimes when your balance sheet is healthy enough, creditors will overlook other requirements. With a lot of financial assets, you are a solid low-risk borrower. \n\n Conditions: What Else Is Going On? \n\n There may be “external” conditions that affect your ability to repay a debt. Conditions refer to the overall economic climate and external environment. For example, if the economy is slowing and many people in your geographic area are losing their jobs, creditors may be less willing to give you a loan. If you lose your job, you may not be able to meet your payments. Therefore, creditors want to know the answers to questions such as the following: How secure is your job? How secure is the firm for which you work? How is the employment situation in your geographic location and in your occupation? \n\n Collateral: Is the Debt Secured? \n\n Collateral is property pledged to assure repayment of a loan, such as the house, car, or furniture being purchased.

Private corporations also have legal departments that include many staff attorneys who specialize in functions such as contracts, tax, or international business. Some lawyers work in local, state, and federal government positions. \n\n Being a lawyer is a tough and demanding career. Lawyers advise and represent clients, conduct research, interpret laws, present facts, and prepare and file legal documents. Many people assume that they need to seek legal help only under dire circumstances. However, people can hire lawyers for legal advice as a preventative measure to avoid legal problems in business and personal matters. \n\n Employment Outlook \n\n An average rate of employment growth is expected. Competition could be strong because more students graduate from law school each year. \n\n Job Titles \n\n Lawyer • Attorney Counselor of Record \n\n Needed Skills \n\n Must have a bachelor’s degree plus law degree (JD). Must pass bar exam for each state in which law is practiced. \n\n Excellent communication skills (reading, writing, speaking, and listening). Excellent negotiation skills. Must maintain high ethical and confidentiality standards. \n\n What’s it like to work in . . Law \n\n Bryan earned his law degree and passed the bar exam several years ago. He started his career with a large firm, where he works on cases under the supervision of a partner for the firm. His specialty is family law, and he has a dozen cases for which he is directly responsible. His annual salary is $\\S120{,}000$ . \n\n Bryan enjoys working with people to help them resolve their disputes. He especially likes putting together property settlement agreements. \n\n Today, Bryan is meeting with a client who is filing for a divorce. He will obtain personal and financial information from his client in order to work out a divorce agreement that is in his client’s best interest. To come to a settlement, Bryan will enter negotiations with the other spouse’s attorney. \n\n What About You? \n\n Are you prepared for seven years of college?

Private corporations also have legal departments that include many staff attorneys who specialize in functions such as contracts, tax, or international business. Some lawyers work in local, state, and federal government positions. \n\n Being a lawyer is a tough and demanding career. Lawyers advise and represent clients, conduct research, interpret laws, present facts, and prepare and file legal documents. Many people assume that they need to seek legal help only under dire circumstances. However, people can hire lawyers for legal advice as a preventative measure to avoid legal problems in business and personal matters. \n\n Employment Outlook \n\n An average rate of employment growth is expected. Competition could be strong because more students graduate from law school each year. \n\n Job Titles \n\n Lawyer • Attorney Counselor of Record \n\n Needed Skills \n\n Must have a bachelor’s degree plus law degree (JD).

What may appear to be a great deal can be a very expensive lesson that hurts your credit rating. Watch for the following signs that the credit offer is not as good as it sounds: \n\n ■■ Low Introductory Rate. Interest rate offers may be as low as 0 percent for six months. The fine print may tell you that if you are late by even one day in making a payment, the rate will rise to 25 to 30 percent or more! This introductory rate may be subject to change without notice.   \n■■ Fixed Percentage Rate. The offer may say the interest rate is fixed, which should mean that it will not go up. But the fine print may tell you that the fixed rate is subject to change without notice and that it can be “adjusted” (raised) at the option of the creditor.   \n■ Closed Account Rate. You may see fine print that says “closed account rate.” This is the rate you will be assessed if you close your account. These rates are often very high—25 to 30 percent or more! This tactic is used by credit card issuers to keep you from closing your account when they raise your interest rate. Without this clause, consumers could reject a change in terms regarding interest rates, close the account, and continue making payments based on the original agreement until the balance is paid off.   \n■■ Late Fees. Most credit card issuers charge a late fee if you do not pay the minimum payment amount by the specified due date. You may also discover that if you are repeatedly late with your payments, the issuer will raise your interest rate. On credit reports, your late payments can make you appear to be a high risk, so other creditors may also raise your interest rates.   \n■■ Over-the-Limit Fees. Card issuers will charge you a fee for exceeding your credit limit. This fee is added to your balance, meaning it will take even more money to pay the account down (remember, interest charges are increasing your balance daily). Fine print may tell you that if you go over the limit, your interest rate will increase.   \n■■ Transaction Fees. Some credit card companies allow you to transfer balances from other credit cards. They may also provide you with access checks where you can borrow money without preapproval. There may be very high transaction fees for these types of borrowing, such as 3 to 10 percent of the transaction amount, in addition to flat fees, such as $s_{30}$ . \n\n To avoid being taken advantage of, read the credit offers carefully and compare them to offers by known lenders, such as your credit union or bank. Ask questions and be sure you understand the terms and conditions. \n\n Think Critically \n\n 1.\t Look for a credit card offer in your mail. Then read the fine print. Make a list of all the potential “traps” you find.   \n2.\t Discuss credit offers with your parents and other adults and ask about their experience with credit offers.

Voluntary bankruptcy, the most common kind, occurs when a debtor files a petition with a federal court asking to be declared bankrupt. The court notifies your creditors of the pending bankruptcy. Once notice is given, creditors may file claims. The court decides how much debt you will pay, what assets you can keep, and what debts will be canceled or discharged. Discharged debt refers to previous debts erased by the court during bankruptcy proceedings. Creditors can no longer seek payment for these debts. Some debts are not discharged and must still be paid. These include child support, alimony, income taxes and penalties, student loans, and court-ordered damages due to malicious or illegal acts. \n\n Involuntary bankruptcy occurs when creditors file a petition with the court, asking the court to declare the debtor bankrupt. Involuntary bankruptcy petitions do not occur very often because most creditors would prefer to be repaid in full over a period of time rather than settle only for a portion of the debtor’s remaining assets. \n\n The bankruptcy process deals with debtors in one of two ways: liquidation or reorganization. Under liquidation, the court sells the debtor’s assets and uses the proceeds to pay as much of the debt as possible. Usually the value of all of the debtor’s assets is not enough to pay off all the debts. The court appoints a trustee to sell the assets and give each creditor a share. Under reorganization, debtors may keep their property but must submit a payment plan to the court for repaying a substantial portion of their debts. The types of bankruptcy available to individuals can be distinguished by which of these two methods is used. \n\n Chapter 7 Bankruptcy \n\n Commonly called straight bankruptcy, Chapter 7 is a liquidation form of bankruptcy for individuals. It wipes out most debts in exchange for giving up most assets. Some assets that are considered necessary for survival may be retained. \n\n The advantage of Chapter 7 bankruptcy is immediate debt relief—large debts are wiped out as well as any payments on the debt. As soon as bankruptcy is filed, all collections must stop. Debtors have a clean slate to start over. However, bankruptcy laws passed in 2005 have made it more difficult for a person to qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \n\n Chapter 13 Bankruptcy \n\n Chapter 13 is a reorganization (payment plan) form of bankruptcy for individuals. It allows debtors to keep most of their property and use their income to pay a portion of their debts over three to five years. Debtors work out a court-enforced repayment plan whereby they make a single monthly payment directly to the court. The court then disburses the funds to the creditors. Under Chapter 13, some debts are totally discharged, while others are paid off as agreed within the payment plan. Chapter 13 may seem like a better option for the debtor in terms of reestablishing credit. However, the blemish on the debtor’s credit record caused by any form of bankruptcy is hard to overcome for many years. \n\n"

                "value": "Capacity \n\n Contractual capacity refers to the competence (legal ability) of the parties to enter into a contract. Competent parties are people who are legally capable of agreeing to a binding offer. Those who are unable to protect themselves because of mental deficiency or illness, or who are otherwise incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions, cannot be held to contracts. Minors have limited contractual capacity, which means that they may legally set aside contractual obligations. This privilege is allowed to protect minors from those who would take advantage of them. \n\n Legality \n\n To be legally enforceable, a contract must have a lawful purpose. A court will not require a person to perform an agreed-upon act if it is illegal. Some contracts must have a special form to be legally enforceable. For example, a contract for sale of real estate would have to contain a specific legal description of the property. A deed to transfer title to property would have to be notarized. When a document is notarized, the signature is verified by a notary public, who then applies a notary seal. \n\n Statute of Frauds \n\n Every state has a statute of frauds, which requires that some contracts must be in writing to be enforceable. The purpose of this law is to prevent harm due to fraudulent conduct (intentional deceit). Examples include the following: \n\n Contracts for the sale of real property (homes and land) Contracts that cannot be fully performed in less than a year Contracts involving the sale of goods for $\\mathbb{S}500$ and over Contracts in which one person agrees to pay the debts of another Contracts in consideration of marriage \n\n These types of agreements must be in writing because they involve special rules. For example, a prenuptial agreement is a contract that specifies what will happen if a marriage ends in divorce. Generally, if two parties of unequal wealth enter into a marriage, a prenuptial agreement may be required in which the person without wealth agrees that he or she will receive a set amount as a settlement, rather than half of what the other person owns, if the marriage ends. This type of agreement serves to protect an individual’s assets from a spouse who may have entered into the marriage fraudulently for financial gain. \n\n Responsibilities of Agreements \n\n When people enter into contracts, they have several responsibilities. They should do the following: \n\n ■ Fill in all blank spaces or indicate N/A for items that are not applicable.   \n■■ Write all terms clearly. Vague phrases are often not enforceable. Enter dates, amounts, and other numbers correctly and clearly. Be sure the seller has supplied all relevant information, including rate of interest, total finance charges, cash payment price, and so on. \n\n"

Closed-end credit is a loan for a specific amount that must be repaid in full, including all finance charges, by a specified due date. Often called installment credit, closed-end agreements do not allow continuous borrowing or varying payment amounts. The borrower takes out a closed-end loan for a particular amount and then repays it with fixed payments, or installments, that include principal and interest. \n\n The contract for closed-end credit states, among other things, the amount loaned, the total finance charge, and the amount of each payment. Sometimes a down payment is required. The product purchased with the loan becomes collateral to assure repayment. \n\n Service Credit \n\n Almost everyone uses some type of service credit. Service credit involves providing a service for which you will pay later. Your telephone and utility services are provided for a month in advance; then you are billed. Many businesses—including doctors, lawyers, hospitals, dry cleaners, and repair shops—extend service credit. Terms are set by individual businesses. Some of these creditors do not impose finance charges on unpaid account balances, but they do expect regular payments to be made until the bill is paid in full. ­Others, such as utility and telephone companies, expect payment in full by a specified due date.

You can also get credit cards through your financial institution or other organizations. These companies offer many different types of credit cards, including all-purpose cards and affinity cards. \n\n All-purpose cards are credit cards that are generally accepted nationwide, and even internationally, to pay for just about anything, from clothes at department stores to meals at restaurants. With an all-purpose credit card, you have an automatic line of credit up to the limit set by the card issuer. Some cards even allow you to take a cash advance, which is money borrowed against your line of credit. You can access this money at an ATM, at a customer service desk in your bank, or by writing an access check against the credit card account. Access checks, which are supplied by the credit card company, look just like regular checks and are treated by the credit card company as a purchase. You must pay back the cash advance in the same way that you pay for credit card purchases. There is often a transaction fee for this service in addition to interest charges, which may or may not be the same interest rate applied to purchases made with the card. \n\n"

American Express and Diners Club are example of charge cards. \n\n Revolving Accounts \n\n With a revolving account, the consumer has the option of paying the balance in full by the due date or making payments at least as high as the stated minimum. The minimum payment is based on the amount of the balance due. If the balance is not paid in full, interest is charged on the balance. \n\n Most all-purpose credit cards, such as Visa, MasterCard, and Discover, as well as store accounts, are revolving credit agreements. Retail store cards, such as department store and gasoline company cards, are also based on revolving credit. Like charge cards, many of these offer rewards or rebate programs. Figure 7.1 shows a credit card statement for a revolving credit account. \n\n Credit Card Agreements \n\n Credit card companies keep a record of transactions made on your account and send you a bill at the end of each billing cycle. If you pay off the balance in full each month, a finance charge likely can be avoided. But remember, a credit card is a form of borrowing and usually involves interest and other charges. Before selecting a credit card, be sure to compare the following terms that will affect the overall cost of the credit you will be using. \n\n ■■ Annual Percentage Rate. The annual percentage rate (APR) is the cost of credit expressed as a yearly percentage. The Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to include all loan costs in the APR. The APR must be disclosed to you when you open the account and must be noted on each monthly bill you receive. Usually the APR is a variable rate, and it can be very high on credit cards. Sometimes credit cards offer an introductory rate, which is often lower than the actual rate. Grace Period. The grace period is a timeframe within which you may pay your current balance in full and incur no finance charge. The grace period runs from the end of a billing cycle to the next payment due date. Under the Credit CARD Act of 2009, if your credit card balance has a grace period, your statement must be mailed or delivered to you at least 21 days before the finance charge would be added to your balance. If there is no grace period specified, the card issuer will impose a finance charge from the date you use your credit card. ■■ Annual Fees. Many credit card issuers charge an annual fee. The fee can range from $\\mathbb{S}40$ to up to $\\mathcal{S}100$ or more, and you must pay it whether or not you use the card. The annual fee might be a one-time charge on your credit card during a specific month of the year, or it could be divided and charged to your account monthly. Most cards with an annual fee offer better rewards opportunities than cards without an annual fee. ■ Transaction Fees. If you use a credit card check (access check), pay by phone, or request a balance transfer, you may be charged a transaction fee. These fees may run from 3 to 10 percent of the transaction amount. Penalty Fees. If you go over your credit limit or make a late payment, you are likely to be charged a penalty fee. Under the Credit CARD Act of \n\n"

                "value": "Traditionally, consumers in Thailand preferred to use cash when purchasing goods and services. This conservative attitude toward   \ncashless transactions hindered consumer credit ex  \npansion. In 2002 it was estimated that only 10 per  \ncent of the Thai population had a credit card. Major   \ncard issuers then began aggressive marketing cam  \npaigns and promotional offers to entice new cus  \ntomers. With extensive incentives for consumers and   \na low minimum income threshold for credit card \n\n eligibility, many card issuers witnessed considerable growth in their customer numbers. Today, many consumers in Thailand rely on credit. \n\n Think C r i t i c a l ly \n\n What consumer benefits as well as problems might result from the boom in credit card use in Thailand? How can consumers avoid the disadvantages of credit as it grows in popularity? \n\n LO 1-2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Credit \n\n Credit can be good when used wisely; however, many people get into trouble each year by not using credit carefully. Like most things in life, there are advantages and disadvantages to using credit. \n\n Advantages of Credit \n\n When used correctly, credit has several advantages: \n\n Purchasing Power. Credit can greatly expand your purchasing power and raise your standard of living. For example, most people are not able to purchase expensive items, such as a car or house, simply by saving money and paying cash. Credit allows you to purchase these items and then pay for them over time. As a result, you can enjoy these items earlier in your life. In addition to things you want, credit also allows you to purchase things in life that you need. For example, the cost of education is continuously rising, and most Americans will need to obtain a loan to pay for college.   \nSecurity. Using a credit card is safer than carrying a large amount of cash with you. If you lose cash, there is no way to replace it. If you lose a credit card, you can simply call the company and report your lost or stolen card. The company will freeze your account, and you will not be held responsible for fraudulent charges.   \nEstablishing Good Credit. Having a good credit history is important, not only when applying for credit cards but also when applying for loans, rental housing, and employment. Making payments on time will help you build a good credit history and qualify for loans and lower interest rates. Emergencies. Credit can also provide emergency funds. A sudden need for cash can be solved by a line of credit, which is a pre-established amount that can be borrowed on demand with no collateral. To establish a line of credit, you must go to a lender, such as a bank, and apply for it. The lender examines your income and financial position and approves an amount that it believes you can repay. With a line of credit, money is always available should you need it. \n\n"

                "value": "Traditionally, consumers in Thailand preferred to use cash when purchasing goods and services. This conservative attitude toward   \ncashless transactions hindered consumer credit ex  \npansion. In 2002 it was estimated that only 10 per  \ncent of the Thai population had a credit card. Major   \ncard issuers then began aggressive marketing cam  \npaigns and promotional offers to entice new cus  \ntomers. With extensive incentives for consumers and   \na low minimum income threshold for credit card \n\n eligibility, many card issuers witnessed considerable growth in their customer numbers. Today, many consumers in Thailand rely on credit. \n\n Think C r i t i c a l ly \n\n What consumer benefits as well as problems might result from the boom in credit card use in Thailand? How can consumers avoid the disadvantages of credit as it grows in popularity? \n\n LO 1-2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Credit \n\n Credit can be good when used wisely; however, many people get into trouble each year by not using credit carefully. Like most things in life, there are advantages and disadvantages to using credit. \n\n Advantages of Credit \n\n When used correctly, credit has several advantages: \n\n Purchasing Power. Credit can greatly expand your purchasing power and raise your standard of living. For example, most people are not able to purchase expensive items, such as a car or house, simply by saving money and paying cash. Credit allows you to purchase these items and then pay for them over time. As a result, you can enjoy these items earlier in your life. In addition to things you want, credit also allows you to purchase things in life that you need. For example, the cost of education is continuously rising, and most Americans will need to obtain a loan to pay for college.   \nSecurity. Using a credit card is safer than carrying a large amount of cash with you. If you lose cash, there is no way to replace it. If you lose a credit card, you can simply call the company and report your lost or stolen card. The company will freeze your account, and you will not be held responsible for fraudulent charges.   \nEstablishing Good Credit. Having a good credit history is important, not only when applying for credit cards but also when applying for loans, rental housing, and employment. Making payments on time will help you build a good credit history and qualify for loans and lower interest rates. Emergencies. Credit can also provide emergency funds. A sudden need for cash can be solved by a line of credit, which is a pre-established amount that can be borrowed on demand with no collateral. To establish a line of credit, you must go to a lender, such as a bank, and apply for it. The lender examines your income and financial position and approves an amount that it believes you can repay. With a line of credit, money is always available should you need it. \n\n"

This student expects to receive a total of $\\S420$ and plans to use the money for certain needs and wants. He also wants to put some money into savings for the future. Notice that total income equals the total of savings plus expenses. A balanced budget is one where the total income is equal to total savings and expenses. When you spend no more than what you take in, your budget remains in balance. \n\n Budget Line Items \n\n Some people create a monthly budget by taking an annual budget and dividing it into 12 months. This can be helpful for people who do not have a regular monthly income. Line items in a budget represent each item of income and spending that are anticipated during the month or year. Some line items occur only once a year. Other line items may occur monthly, such as rent or insurance. \n\n There are two types of expenses. Fixed expenses are costs that do not change from month to month. You are obligated to pay them regardless of income changes. For example, people must pay rent or a house payment, a car loan, and insurance premiums when they are due. Most financial experts recommend that a family have fixed expenses of no more than 50 to 60 percent of take-home, or net, pay. However, this standard is difficult to achieve for young people just starting life on their own. But with time, pay raises, and careful budgeting, a family can achieve that goal. \n\n Variable expenses are costs that vary in amount and type, depending on the choices you make. For example, your grocery bill can be larger or smaller, depending on what you choose to buy. Other examples of variable expenses are costs for eating out, going to movies, and buying clothes. \n\n Figure 4.2 shows a monthly budget for a married couple.

Worksheet 4 is provided for you in the Student Activity Guide and also presented below. Keep copies of your tax returns. Compare total tax by preparing Forms 1040EZ, 1040A, and 1040. Use the form that gives the greatest tax advantage (i.e., the lowest amount of taxes). Then study tax booklets and other information to see where you can benefit from taking more deductions. \n\n WORKSHEET 4 Tax Liability \n\n Directions: To complete this worksheet, frst list your gross income, adjusted gross income, taxable income, tax before credits, and total tax for the last three years you have fled tax returns and paid income taxes.

Before you can prepare a budget, you may wish to keep track of money coming in and going out for a month or two. This will give you a clearer idea of what you can expect. Many people keep a journal or log where they record everything they spend. They may keep receipts for cash items. This record forms the basis of understanding what’s happening in your current financial picture. \n\n Visualize Your Future \n\n Once you have a good idea of what comes in and how it goes out, you can then start thinking about changes you’d like to make. For many people, just keeping track of what you receive and how you spend it makes a difference. When people can actually see how much they spend on something, they may decide there are other things they’d rather do. Money you spend should reveal your values, choices, and priorities. But taking the next step—actually preparing a budget—will make your financial planning visions a reality. \n\n Prepare a Budget \n\n The next step toward achieving your financial goals is to prepare a budget. A budget is a spending and saving plan based on your expected income and expenses. In a budget, money coming in (earnings, gifts, borrowing) must equal money going out (spending and saving). The budget must balance. A budget helps you plan your spending and saving so you won’t have to borrow money or use credit to meet your daily needs. \n\n Steps in Preparing a Budget \n\n The steps in preparing a budget are as follows: \n\n 1.\tEstimate your total expected income for a certain time period. Include all money you expect to receive. Use a weekly, biweekly, or monthly budget whichever best matches how often you expect to receive money.   \n2.\tEstimate your expenses, or money you will need for day-to-day purchases—for example, lunches, fees, personal care items, and clothing.   \n3.\tDecide how much of your income you want to save, or set aside, for future needs. Most experts advise saving 10 percent of your disposable income each pay period. By saving, you will have money to pay for future needs, both expected and unexpected.   \n4.\tBalance your budget. If your expenses plus savings exceed your income, adjust your budget to make them balance. To do this, you may have to delay buying some items you want but don’t need. Or you may decide to save a little less this month. If you can’t cut your expenses, then you have to increase your income. \n\n"

When you make choices, they often involve making a trade-off, or getting something in return for giving up something else. The trade-off results in an opportunity cost, which is the value of your next best choice—what you are giving up. For example, in the chapter-opening scenario, Hector's resources (time and money) are limited, so he has to make a trade-off between spending time with his friends and working. Both options have opportunity costs. Suppose ­Hector could earn $\\S2{,}000$ by working over the summer. If he decides to spend the summer with his friends, the opportunity cost of his choice is the $\\S2{,}000$ income he gives up. If he decides to work, the opportunity cost of that choice is the value to him of the time he could have spent with his friends. Part of comparing choices is considering the value of the options that would be given up. \n\n When comparing choices, convenience should be considered as well. In some cases, convenience may be more important than cost, as long as the cost is reasonable. Using the laptop example, you may decide that the convenience of having your own computer and being able to use it anytime you need it is worth the extra dollar cost. You may also decide that even though the cost of buying a new laptop will be greater, you prefer to avoid the uncertainty of possible repairs if you buy a used laptop. \n\n Step 4: Make a Decision \n\n If you follow the steps outlined in the preceding paragraphs, the decision you make will be based on careful consideration of the problem, a thorough collection of data, and an analysis of that data. The wise decision in any situation is the one that best meets your needs, is within your budget, and gives you the most value for your dollar investment. Take the time you need to carefully evaluate the information you gathered about each choice before you make a decision, especially for expensive or complex products. \n\n Step 5: Take Action \n\n After you make a decision, then take action to implement your chosen solution. Because you have made a thorough analysis of choices for solving your problem, you can be sure that you have made the best decision you could with the available information. \n\n Step 6: Reevaluate Your Choice \n\n After several months have passed, revisit your decision and evaluate whether you “solved” the problem or met the need you identified in Step 1. Are you happy with the choice you made? If not, what could you do differently next time to make a better decision? Should you do something different now? If your needs have changed or your initial decision isn’t working out, go through the decision-making process again to decide whether to make a change. \n\n Checkpoint \n\n What steps are involved in the decision-making process? \n\n"

The same brand often sells at considerably different prices at different retailers, depending on the sellers’ markups. By shopping at various retailers you may be able to save money. In addition, many stores offer sale prices at various times of the year or at regular intervals. \n\n The Internet makes comparison shopping easy. There are numerous comparison shopping sites, such as BizRate and PriceGrabber, that allow individuals to see different prices for specific products.

The same brand often sells at considerably different prices at different retailers, depending on the sellers’ markups. By shopping at various retailers you may be able to save money. In addition, many stores offer sale prices at various times of the year or at regular intervals. \n\n The Internet makes comparison shopping easy. There are numerous comparison shopping sites, such as BizRate and PriceGrabber, that allow individuals to see different prices for specific products.

Variations of in-store displays include window displays, which are located in the business’s storefront area and show merchandise offered by the store. Feature displays are located at the end of aisles to draw attention to a product. Many stores use point-of-sale displays located near cash registers to encourage impulse buying. Some stores use special racks, where store shelf space is modified to make more space available for new or promoted products or seasonal items. Many displays have themes based on holidays, such as Halloween, Thanksgiving, or Christmas. Color schemes, decorations, music, and special effects often are used to make in-store displays more visually appealing to consumers. \n\n Contests and Sweepstakes \n\n Retail stores and restaurants that depend on repeat customers often use contests and sweepstakes to bring customers into the business. The possibility of winning something or getting something free is appealing. Large and small prizes are offered to get customers to come back and buy more. Careful reading of the rules of the contest or sweepstakes reveals the customer’s chances of winning. Usually, the chances of winning a major prize are very small. \n\n Coupons \n\n Manufacturer coupons offer instantly redeemable savings on specific products and may be redeemed wherever the product is sold. Store coupons offer discounts on specific products, usually for a short period of time, and only at a specific store. Manufacturer and store coupons can be found inside or on a package, in newspapers or magazines, on a store shelf or an in-store display, and online. Coupons are a form of mass marketing—an attempt to reach large numbers of consumers at once. \n\n Rebates \n\n Rebates offer money back to the consumer. They are offered by either the featured product’s retailer or manufacturer. The most common types of rebates are mail-in rebates and instant rebates. With a mail-in rebate, the consumer typically has to mail a filled-out rebate form, a receipt, and the product’s barcode within a specified time period to the retailer or manufacturer. In return, the store or manufacturer will send a check, gift card, or prepaid card for a specific amount to the consumer, usually within 6 to 8 weeks. An instant rebate occurs when a product is advertised at a specific price and the discount is applied at the time of purchase. For example, an electronics store may advertise an HDTV for $\\oint(99.99)\\$ with a $\\S100.00$ instant rebate. The $\\S100.00$ is taken off the total price by the cashier at checkout, and the consumer pays only $\\mathinner{\\mathfrak{S}}599.99$ for the television. \n\n"

Some stores and restaurants use frequent-buyer cards that are punched, stamped, or initialed by clerks with each purchase. Those customers who accumulate enough punches may receive some type of reward, such as a gift certificate or free merchandise. \n\n Customer-loyalty programs offer lower prices, rebates, point-of-sale coupons, or other valued services to enrolled members. Each time the customer makes a purchase at the store, his or her account is accessed. This practice allows the store to track individual purchasing patterns and target advertising accordingly. Customer-loyalty programs often are used by grocery stores and pharmacies. \n\n Packaging \n\n Packages do more than just protect the product. They are also promotional tools. A product’s packaging is often what compels consumers to look at a new product. Manufacturers design packaging to appeal to the eye as well as to provide the necessary product information. The visual aspects of the package— color, graphics/pictures, size, and shape—play an important part in attracting consumers’ attention. Packaging should also emphasize special features about the product, such as “fat free,” “new and improved,” and “organic.” Manufacturers may also include coupons inside or on the package. \n\n Sampling \n\n Many companies promote their products through sampling. This can reduce consumers’ apprehension about buying a new product or introduce them to a product with which they are unfamiliar. Samples are often given out in a store or shopping mall. Sometimes samples of nonperishable items are included in direct marketing mailings to households. Many companies now offer free samples through their websites. This not only encourages consumers to use the product but also allows the company to gather data for marketing purposes. \n\n Micromarketing \n\n Many companies buy marketing data about consumers. Demographics include information about a person's age, gender, race, marital status, income, education level, and occupation. Psychographics describe consumers’ lifestyle, interests, and attitudes. This information is gathered from purchases, customer-loyalty programs, public information, Internet shopping, and other sources provided by the government, postal service, banks, and credit bureaus. Micromarketing is a marketing strategy designed to target specific people who are likely to buy certain products. For example, when a couple has a child, they are likely to receive ads, samples, and coupons for baby products because the birth record of the child is public information. These targeted (micromarketing) promotions are efficient. Rather than pay the cost of mailing samples of baby products to everyone, baby product manufacturers can send samples only to consumers with babies. \n\n Checkpoint \n\n How do promotional techniques increase sales? \n\n"
